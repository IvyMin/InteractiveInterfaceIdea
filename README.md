# Michaels-Marketing

Date: 2020

A collaboration with another student for a coding project during school. We had to create marketing/promotional material for in-store experiences. We chose Michaels, the art store in Canada. 

How-to-use:
This experiment uses your camera to sense your motion. Interact with our interface and watch the colours that you draw! You can save your creation into your desktop.
